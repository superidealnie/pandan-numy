    "So, NumPy runs nearly an order of magnitude faster! This is because of those two points above. Because NumPy arrays store data in contiguous blocks of memory, they are able to take advantage of **vectorization**, which is the ability of a CPU to perform one operation on multiple pieces of data at once. In addition, since a NumPy array knows what type each object it is storing is (and those types don't change), it doesn't have to waste time checking what type each object is (like a list). The combo of these two things speeds up our calculation quite a bit.\n",

They might have some slightly different naming conventions (`idxmax` on a column versus `argmax` on a NumPy array, for example), but since pandas DataFrames are built on NumPy arrays, the methods available on NumPy arrays largely coincide with the methods available on pandas DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these methods are available as functions on the `NumPy` module itself, as well. Just like we can call the `argmax()` method on a NumPy array, we can call `np.argmax()` and pass in a list or tuple. Before we move back to DataFrames, let's look at one last method that is available in `NumPy`, `np.where()`. `np.where()` can help us to find what elements in a NumPy array meet some condition. "
